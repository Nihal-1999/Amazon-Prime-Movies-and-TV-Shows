# Amazon Prime Video Dashboard (Power BI)
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Amazon Prime Video content with visuals, charts, and key metrics for titles, ratings, genres, and release trends.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The dashboard shows key information about Amazon Prime Videoâ€™s content library.
It helps to understand things like total titles, genres, ratings, release years, and countries where most shows are produced.
I tried to make it look similar to Amazon Primeâ€™s theme using their brand colors and logo.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used in this project was a CSV file containing the following columns:

* Show ID
* Type (Movie / TV Show)
* Title
* Director
* Cast
* Country
* Date Added
* Release Year
* Rating
* Duration
* Genre
* Description

The dataset was provided in the YouTube tutorial and used only for learning purposes.

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Visuals

Hereâ€™s what I added to the dashboard:

* Cards showing Total Titles, Ratings, Genres, Directors, Start & End Year
* Bar Chart for Ratings by Total Shows
* Bar Chart for Genres by Total Shows
* Map showing total titles by country
* Donut Chart comparing Movies and TV Shows
* Area Chart showing total shows by release year
All visuals follow Amazon Prime Videoâ€™s dark blue theme and logo.
