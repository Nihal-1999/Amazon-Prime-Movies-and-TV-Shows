# Amazon Prime Video Dashboard (Power BI)
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Amazon Prime Video content with visuals, charts, and key metrics for titles, ratings, genres, and release trends.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The dashboard shows key information about Amazon Prime Videoâ€™s content library.
It helps to understand things like total titles, genres, ratings, release years, and countries where most shows are produced.
I tried to make it look similar to Amazon Primeâ€™s theme using their brand colors and logo.
